# HappyMod APK Evidence (Raw)

This directory documents Android package (APK) files related to the HappyMod
application that are present on the capture/analysis device. The APK binaries
themselves are **not** tracked in Git; only this README and the hash manifest
are version-controlled.

## Hash Manifest

The file `happymod_apks.sha256` in this directory contains one line per APK,
in the standard `sha256sum` format:

```text
<sha256>  <absolute_path_to_apk>
```

This manifest is generated by running, from the repository root:

```bash
cd "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/repos/forensics-review" && ./install_happymod_apk_docs.sh
```

Current manifest metadata:

- Path: `evidence/raw/apk/happymod_apks.sha256`
- SHA-256 of manifest contents: `c9e356384895371de1ca329423dc0b9ac8e2d8ad8b47dba3cfc8cdc2a800544f`

If any APK paths become invalid in the future (e.g., files are moved or deleted),
the recorded hashes still describe the original files.

## Discovery Procedure

APKs are discovered via:

```bash
find "$HOME" -maxdepth 8 \
  \( -iname 'happymod.apk' -o -iname 'happymod*.apk' \) \
  2>/dev/null | sort
```

This includes typical variants such as:

- `happymod.apk`
- `happymod_base.apk`
- `happymod_base__<suffix>.apk`

Re-running `install_happymod_apk_docs.sh` will rescan the filesystem and
regenerate both the manifest and this README to reflect current state.

## Scope

This directory is **non-interpretive**. It only records that certain APK
artifacts existed at particular filesystem paths with particular SHA-256 hashes
at the time of generation. It does **not** assert intent, behavior, or any
legal or policy conclusion about those artifacts.
